# OSMind

OSMind is a software developed for facilitation of visualization, mapping and navigation on a single platform.

We have used the various frameworks like RTAB-Map, Digital Elevation Models(DEM), Unity3D and V-REP to take the input file from a stereo camera and create a Virtual 3D environment which can be used for navigation. During navigation, a video is recorded and Computer Vision can be applied to this recorded file to extract important information from the 3D environment. This includes Face Detection, Object Recognition, Colour Detection and Text Recognition.
